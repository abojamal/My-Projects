    "### Project Scope:\n",
    "Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering and advanced regression techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "Many people estimate the house price based on essential features such as the total area or number of rooms in the house â€¦However, this project will prove that much more factors influence house prices. Having a pricing model based on 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa will help both buyers and sellers to figure out the right price.\n",

    "### Data:\n",
    "Dataset With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa will be used to predict sales price.\n",
    "Data Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)\n",
    "A brief version of each column in data description file is provided. Please refer to data description file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses:\n",
    "There seems to be a positive correlation between the area and the house price. Also, having more features like a pool for example increases the price.\n",
    "My aim is to achieve the lowest possible Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks:\n",
    "The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. Hence, there is a degree of uncertainty about the data accuracy. Also, unfamiliarity with residential homes in Ames, Iowa might affect final price accuracy.\n",
